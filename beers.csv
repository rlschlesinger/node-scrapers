       description: 'We are a three-barrel brew house born from the shadows of long tenured Portland restaurant, Philadelphia’s Steaks & Hoagies. The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon’s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60′ TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events. Go Blazers!\r\n\r\nSome would say our legendary steak sandwiches and two dozen rotating taps are a match made in heaven. Please join us and stop by to see what’s new!',

And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.\r\n\r\nToday, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion – brewing great beer – with 14th Star Brewing Co.\r\n\r\n14th Star is Steve’s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.\r\n\r\nNanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.\r\n\r\nWhat makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it’s about the only brewery in Vermont that’s located above Burlington. Period.\r\n\r\nBut that’s not it. Not entirely.\r\n\r\nYou see – this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that’s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.\r\nOn our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July. (Check out our Pint of Progress on our home page.)\r\n\r\nWe can’t wait to watch you let your hair down and lift your glass, Vermont. We’ll enjoy that. And remember – this is your beer.

The area was “16 miles from anywhere” in the county and was the best place for farmers, merchants, and politicians to meet to conduct official business. Georgetown replaced Lewes as the County Seat when numerous petitions were sent to Delaware’s General Assembly requesting that the move be made to accommodate all county residents.

All from a very small space. 192 square feet to be exact. We have packed only the essentials into our brewery. We make every batch by hand and we nurture it every step of the way.

In late 2011 we moved up to 10 gallon batches. Brewing is not only a hobby but a way of life for us, once we started we just couldn’t seem to stop. We really enjoy the process of making the beer as well the finished product. Some of the success we have had in home brewing competitions has only given us confidence and motivation to take our hobby further. We plan on expanding our system to produce 7-10 barrels per batch in 2012 as well as filing the necessary paperwork to begin a legitimate brewery, distributing our beers to the public.',

With its high elevation and cool evening temperatures,the area is known for its high quality wheat and malting barley. After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby – brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients. Owners Barry and Chris Hedrich and their basset hounds Stanley and Leroy look forward to seeing you in beautiful White Sulphur Springs.',
